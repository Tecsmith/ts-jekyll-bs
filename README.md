A [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) Theme shaped arround:
- [**Bootstrap** 4](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4.6.2)
- [**Bootsrap Dark** *(4)*](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark)
- [**FontAwesome** 5](https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/)

## Installation

> `TO DO`

## Contents At-A-Glance

`ts-jekyll-bs` is scaffolded with the `jekyll new-theme` and can be set up to run with zero-config.  However, if you wish to add complementary content like nav bars, then some configuration is required.

###

Refers to files within the `_layouts` directory, that define the markup for your theme.

  - `base.html` &mdash; The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their
    contents into this file at the line that says ` {{ content }} ` and are linked to this file via *FrontMatter* declaration `layout: base`.
<!-- - `home.html` &mdash; The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page. [[More Info.](#home-layout)] -->
  - `page.html` &mdash; The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts.
  - `post.html` &mdash; The layout for your posts.



## Developing with

#### Set up a new sit in Jekyll

```bash
jekyll new PATH --blank
```
> See [base file tweaks](#base-file-tweaks) for notes on optional modifications to the files generated by this step.

Then `cd` to `PATH`. *(Substitute `PATH` with your site folder name.)*

#### Initialize a new Bundler project

```bash
bundle init
```

#### Edit `Gemfile` to add Jekyll, this theme, and `jeyyll-remote-theme` as a dependency

```rb
gem "jekyll", '~> 4.3'

gem 'ts-jekyll-bs', '>= 0.1.0', :git => 'http://github.com/tecsmith/ts-jekyll-bs.git', branch: 'main'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-remote-theme', '~> 0.4'
end
```

#### Edit `_config.yml` with this theme and `jeyyll-remote-theme`

```yaml
remote_theme: https://github.com/tecsmith/ts-jekyll-bs

plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
```

#### *(Optional)* Configure Bundler to install gems in a specific directory

```bash
bundle config set --local path "vendor/bundle"
```

#### Run `bundle install` to fetch and install the gems

```bash
bundle install
```

#### Base file tweaks

> ***{Optional}***

The `jekyll new` command generates a few file assumptions that can be tweaked to make the theme work better.

##### Edit `_layouts/default.html`

Add the `base` layout to the front matter, and remove generated content except `{{ content }}`.

```html
---
layout: base
---

{{ content }}
```

##### Delete `_sass/base.scss`

Delete the file `_sass/base.scss`.  This is not needed.

##### Edit `assets\css\main.sess`

Delete the line `@import "base";`.  This is not needed.  The file should start with only the bare frontmatter

```scss
---
---

// ... future edits here
```

##### Edit `index.md`

Change the `default` layout to `base` in the front matter section.

```md
---
layout: base
title: "Happy Jekylling!"
---

## You're ready to go!

Start developing your Jekyll website.
```


#### Develop and test

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --open-url --livereload --livereload-port 4001 --trace
```
